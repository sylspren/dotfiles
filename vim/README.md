My Vim configuration
====================

This folder has my usual vim configuration. I don't have any kind of write-up where I explain it, and I change
it all the time, but fortunately the internet abounds with good vim resources. The main ones I would recommend
are the following:

* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). This is the best vim plugin ever. Manage your packages
  with sanity.
* [Coming Home to Vim](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/). Fantastic post on vim plugins,
  configuration, etc. Beautiful blog, too. I highly recommend reading the whole thing; you'll be inspired to
  do great things with your vim configuration.
* [How I Boosted my Vim](http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/) Decent intro to vim configuration.
* [The Modern Vim Config with Pathogen](http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen)
  Useful post on using Pathogen.
